# Electrified Rail-based Energy Storage
## Overview
It is a repository dedicated to the reproduction and analysis of the Electrified Rail-based Energy Storage (ERES) capacity of electrified railways. The ERES is a novel approach to repurpose trains into a massive, distributed mechanical battery, offering a novel, extremely low-cost solution to accelerate the sustainable transition, as discussed in the paper titled "Transforming electrified railway into running mechanical energy storage for energy transition".
## Repository Structure
* `DEP_evaluation.m`: Function to evaluate deployable ERES power based on the rail operational data.<br>
* `Aggregation_model.m`: Function to generate aggregation model from the ERES capacity.<br>
* `PlotResult.m`: Function to plot the results.<br>
* `Example.m`: Script to demonstrate how to use the functions.<br>
* `TrainConfiguration_example.mat`: The example input file for the functions.<br>
## Usage
The ERES capacity of the example input file can be obtained by running the `Example.m` script. The script demonstrates how to use the functions to calculate the result and plot a figure. The script also demonstrates data structure of the input file. Users can modify and replace the input on demand.
